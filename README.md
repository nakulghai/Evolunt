This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

Please Note : - 
1. This project is only to show javascript and react js knowledge.
2. Project has minimum styling as the purpose of the project was not to test styling skills.
3. I have used materialize-css for css.
4. For Unit Testing I have used expect, sinon libraries.
5. I have used Redux for state management.
